<h2>Casting</h2>
<p>
  The project originally received a script commitment from Fox in August 2011. After Adam Goldberg's previous show, Breaking In, was canceled, he did not want to wait for another pilot season to arrive and moved it to ABC, who agreed to immediately produce it.[16][17] On January 11, 2013, Wendi McLendon-Covey was cast as the pilot's lead;[18] later, Jeff Garlin and George Segal joined the cast.[19][20]
